## Anti-JavaScript JavaScript Club stickers

[Write JavaScript responsibly]({% link _posts/2024-11-02-javascript.md %}), with sticker owning friends from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Germany, Australia, Denmark, Norway, Portugal, Vietnam, Canada, Colombia, England, Brazil, and the US!

I have streamlined this, and the postage is less than ¢50 USD for up to 40 stickers. Don't not worry about it. 

If you run a meet-up or organize a conference, I'm also happy to mail a bunch!

The stickers have a transparent background with an alpha channel and textured finish, and they come with white backing paper.

[Request physical stickers](https://airtable.com/app9Az0zOytgcTTl6/shrkl4nqJsn7p7w5U) shipped from Taiwan, or [download the files](https://github.com/muan/anti-js-js.club/issues/1) for your website.
