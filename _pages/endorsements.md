Written in 2025.

> Mu-An is one of the rare folks working on the web who makes deeply intentional tradeoffs using the best information and technologies available to achieve good outcomes for users. This approach makes her uniquely effective, delivering more value to the widest set of end-users for the least amount of code. In a world of varying device and network capabilities, this creates outsized value to the organisations she works in and with.
> 
> She is also generous with her time, using what she has learned in making compelling experiences for users to inform the development of international standards, including through the W3C where her work has shaped the development of fundamental technologies (including Web Components, Declarative Shadow DOM, and others). This trait is only common among the strongest engineers, and the web is better for her efforts in both areas.

Collaborated after Microsoft acquisition of GitHub with me leading the accessibility work from GitHub. Written in 2024.

> Over the years, we've interacted with hundreds of developers, designers, accessibility specialists, and other stakeholders in the field. Our interactions with Mu-An has been some of the most rewarding, with it being a delight to receive every update and question from her. Her sincerity, exceptional knowledge, passion for doing the right thing, and remarkable endurance are deeply meaningful. We feel a great deal of heartfelt gratitude for all that she has done to make the web more accessible and equitable.

Manager/coworker at GitHub 2013-2020, written in 2017 as a performance review and reaffirmed in 2024.

> Mu-An exhibits all of GitHub's values within our team, working with feature teams on pull requests, and representing GitHub publicly in her open source work. She moved from design to engineering this year, and as one of her teammates put it, "is absolutely killing it."
> 
> I trust Mu-An and have come to rely on her advice in a couple areas: accessibility and web components. She has lead Web Systems' efforts in updating all of the site's custom elements to the v1 spec, that's now shipping in most browsers, and has become an expert in the design tradeoffs of custom elements.
> 
> Web components will be an important building block for the next generation of the site's user interface, particularly with pieces of the app splitting off of the monolith. Mu-An's detailed research and testing of the web component stack has positioned her as a leader in Web Systems.
> 
> Not surprisingly, Mu-An works well with Design Systems and is an important link between our teams.
> 
> She has a keen eye for potential technical complexity and asks simple, direct, disarming questions about new proposals. Asking "why?" makes our team better because it develops our understanding of tradeoffs internally so that we can provide detailed advice on feature teams' pull requests.
