    Life is strange 2 gameplay drags a lot and has a lot of fillers, so isn’t a fun game to play by any means IMO, but the characters are so likeable, and the background stories/context are so rich and well structured. Quite impressive.

    I really wish internationalization settings are more flexible. On PlayStation if I want Chinese subtitles I often need to change my system UI to from English to Chinese, which means voice prompts won't work, and then the game UI also can't be set to English because games usually only have one or two language settings– subtitles and audio, and not UI. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Game content internationalization should prioritize authenticity around the story, while user interface internationalization should prioritize accessibility for the user and social interactions. The data is all there!

It is explicitly stated in Article 38 that "Non-HKer outside HK can violate this law, and the penalty applies" This means it has the potential to affect YOU AS WELL through extradition. "Other countries wouldn't just do what China says, right?" Wouldn't they? Wilder things have happened.

    Pronoun order doesn't seem to matter to most native English speakers. But having been tested 10000 times in English exams on them, I can't stop noticing when people use them incorrectly, and it pains me daily. Please send help.

    I was shocked to see more and more Taiwanese people, who know little about US politics, liking the GOP and people like Ted Cruz. Then I recently found out it is because they are the ones in the US Congress lifting Taiwan’s status up for the democratic nation it is, inviting President Tsai to visit and speak against PRC’s wishes, pushing for bills to establish official relationships between the US and Taiwan. Intentions matter, but what can Taiwanese people take from the silence of the Dems?

As for group travel, the country would end up being the silent host whose presence one forgets like one does an overly timid guest, the principal subject becoming the backdrop.
