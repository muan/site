    With all these talks about “Ukraine now Taiwan next”… regardless of whether that’s a valid comparison, I just want to say that if we find Taiwan in the same situation, I sure hope more of my friends would be voicing their support for us on social media. No, tweeting can’t end a war, but I think it’d definitely give me more hope and strength to go on.

    appreciate the friends who have reached out to recognize what I’ve always been talking about with regards to Taiwan’s political situation isn’t hypothetical… but I feel conflicted… 
    
    I guess it’s just disappointing. we learn to live with threats and risks because what else is there to do? and then we further learn to live with people around us who _like_ the aggressor and praise them when the regime does something “good” because they can afford to ignore the aggressions and threats that we and many experience.
    
    i can’t in any circumstances ever see “good” in a regime that talks about invading my home for as long as i’ve lived. they desperately want to convince everyone that it’d not be an invasion, but a unification (via military forces). bullshit is what it is. 
    
    we seek support in times of relative peace. if we don’t find them in times of peace, will we be able to get them when things get dire? that’s what’s disappointing. when it really does matter, support isn’t going magically appear just because the stakes are high. 
    
    no, i don’t think the situations are alike or comparable on many front, but concerns from friends put things in that frame, and when I think about it with that framing, what’s out there now inspires little confidence. it is just quite disheartening. 🤷🏻‍♀️
    
    i hope these concerns will translate into motivation to support us on things that don’t seem immediately related to war in the traditional sense. even if small as the country `<select>` in your product. 
    
    being apolitical is a vote of support for the existing rich and powerful.

I really don’t want to be seen as if I feel so above it, but I am at a point that I feel like I had to read it up to not be such an outlier. I guess what I’m trying to get at is… how can not caring about celebrity gossip be such a special stance? I’m not trying to be different. 😕

    The Matrix Reloaded (2003): the reason why I can never enjoy sci-fi films boils down to the fact that I just can’t see past the inconsistencies in logic. They make outlandish claims about infinite intelligence and super advanced technology, but still have shape shifting bug robot men losing a fight because they were held by a necktie, and the chosen one with god like abilities and speed to dodge bullets couldn’t outrun a man running to the door. why do everyone insignificant in Zion wears beige? why did agent smiths only pull out a gun they had all along after an escape route was opened by the keymaker? what did the twin expect to happen when they stood in front of Trinity’s speeding car with a pocket knife? why does everyone suck at cable management?… anyways, Seraph is played by a Taiwanese actor, fun fact.

    Thanks to my therapist I’ve been feeling so good in the last 6 months and was even able to make some traditionally nerve-wreaking decisions in life without even flinching. I love that I simply present her with a messy bag of ideas, and worries and she just untangles the wires and sorts them out. Being able to see problems and trade-offs clearly made decisions so much easier.

    I like it when I talk to friends about personal feelings and they feel comfortable suggesting that I book an appointment with my therapist to talk about specific things. They want to help but know they can’t do as good a job as my therapist; what they can do instead was something I can’t do myself, telling me the things I regard as trivial and unworthy of a therapy session, are in fact affecting me in ways I hadn’t noticed before.

    I wish I knew how to step in/out of "the zone". When I get into a programming problem I find it so hard to just switch off. I ended up not sleeping and not eating, and even when I managed to just microwave something I feel like I have to eat in front of the computer so I can keep thinking about the problem. While I enjoy "being in the zone" I can't help but feel like it's just terrible for my well-being. I believe this is partly why I have been trying to stay away from coding as much as possible ever since quitting last year. :(

    I saw people get mad at others calling out that web browsers are meant for document viewing and not applications and want to debate it... The thing is, this really isn’t an opinion though. @kocienda was stating a fact. Document viewing was what the web was designed for. Pulling up examples of what people has used the web for isn’t going to change how the web was designed  and why manipulating it into something it’s not is extremely messy and awkward. To those who think it’s not messy and awkward, I’d have to guess you haven’t done much accessibility work? Just learn to write native code if you want to make apps people (hence why I tried to learn Swift.) How about discussing how to lower the much higher barrier of entry for native app development instead of forcing the web to become an app platform?

    I really wish internationalization settings are more flexible. On PlayStation if I want Chinese subtitles I often need to change my system UI to from English to Chinese, which means voice prompts won't work, and then the game UI also can't be set to English because games usually only have one or two language settings– subtitles and audio, and not UI. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Game content internationalization should prioritize authenticity around the story, while user interface internationalization should prioritize accessibility for the user and social interactions. The data is all there!

On 10 October 1911, the ROC was established, in **China**, when no one on the island of Taiwan spoke Mandarin. The ROC lost to the CCP(PRC) and fled to Taiwan in 1949, declared martial law, banned Taiwanese, and killed people by tens of thousands. I am Taiwanese. Today is not my national day.

    I was shocked to see more and more Taiwanese people, who know little about US politics, liking the GOP and people like Ted Cruz. Then I recently found out it is because they are the ones in the US Congress lifting Taiwan’s status up for the democratic nation it is, inviting President Tsai to visit and speak against PRC’s wishes, pushing for bills to establish official relationships between the US and Taiwan. Intentions matter, but what can Taiwanese people take from the silence of the Dems?

    So blessed to have [@notwaldorf](https://twitter.com/notwaldorf) as a friend. We chatted about cat persons/peppers in zelda/jean jackets/html spec last night and found this gem of [an old &lt;dialog&gt; html 5 draft spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-html5-20080122/#the-dialog) in HTML 5 Working Draft in 2008. 💡
