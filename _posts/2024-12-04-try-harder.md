No, I really can’t.

In the last few years I have learned that the way to keep myself away from suicidal ideation is through resource management.

My insomnia persists. Last night I slept in two 2-hour chunks. I woke up each time lethargic and angry at the unchanged state of my physical and mental health. 

On a good day I can shower, on an excellent day where I literally did nothing, I just might be able to take out the trash. I don’t see people socially because they drain my energy, I don’t make promises because I can’t even keep promises I make to myself. I told friends who asked me to do contract work that I literally can not make any commitments on how many hours each week I would be able to give them. I don't know if this evening I might try swallowing all the pills in my procession, or if I’d wake up tomorrow wishing to die that instance. I try not to, but my best, evidently is often not enough.

I am giving it all already simply managing the state of me being alive. Anything in addition of self-sustaining, depression management, is extra. So much extra.

You saw that I wrote a blog post, designed stickers, and shipped them all over the world. You don’t see I haven’t showered for a week, live amongst trash bags and boxes, have been eating prepared meals and delivery, for months, so that I can go into overdraft to do the things that fulfill my soul, not just sustain my being.

I can’t try harder. I had days in a row in the last months wishing that each day I can get just a bit more desperate, so I would one day be courageous enough to close out this clown show.

I am not writing this so you pity me, I am writing this hoping that you would stop asking me to try harder, to do just a bit more, as if it was easy. Whatever I am able to output right now is already my absolute best. Not a single drop more. I am scraping the bottom of the barrel every single day. Sure, you can think I am weak. I am. I am positively tired of it.

I understand that professionally, this seems like I half-arsing things. Trust me I am more frustrated about this than you can possibly be. Take [[whatwg/html] Toggle (show/hide) button](https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/10499) for example, I gave up rather quickly because I already saved up for a long time to be able to offer up what I did. What you also don't see is the emotional labor under the table that pushed me into overdraft. I am personally not disappointed at myself. I think I did the best I could, and I take comfort in that I tried. People might, like I did, one day look into the history of specification and found odd things that never happened, and thought "Ah, I wish that happened, but this person tried. I wonder who they are and what they're doing now." I found many of my favorite tenured people in the spec world this way.

Would it be better if I do nothing at all? I don't know. But there is [no moisturizer for the soul](https://muan.co/notes/2024-06-24-uu). I just might dry up. 

My therapist suggested that I do something less challenging, less contentious, farther from my core beliefs. 

I don't know what that could be yet.
