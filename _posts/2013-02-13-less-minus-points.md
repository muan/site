title: Optimising for less minus points

The other day, after reading [Phases](/2013/02/07/phase/), [Rob](http://robertheaton.com/) said to me:
> You need to stop optimising for less minus points.

He meant, I do this - I want more of "less bad things happening" than "more good things happening." Since I never looked at things this way, it took me a while to get my head around what he was implying. And as it turns out, he was right. On that, I do.

I know I would now sound like a sad little girl who got dumped and couldn't get over it, well, go ahead and think that. Even when after I became aware of the fact that I'm optimising for less minus point, I don't think it makes sense for me to do things the other way, which is aiming for the plus points.

Let's say we are talking about achieving the same goal - **Happiness**. Who can deny that we all want happiness?<br />
However, what counts as happiness and how we achieve that would vary.

There had been good times, of course, good things happening, things that brought infinite joy to me at the time. But I've gradually come to realise that, if when things come to an end, there would be devastation awaits, then it's not worth it; if when you take risks in the hope of getting happiness in return, you failed and instead gained sadness and frustration, it's not worth it.

I've recently had this discussion with someone, and the only conclusion we came to was, what's worthwhile or not is purely base on the individual. But then again, as Rob insists, some things are just not relative.

I find it even harder to wrap my head around the idea of there is this goal that we the people in the right mind must work towards. Can I not just prefer less sadness over risking for more happiness? Can I not just prefer to have an adequate amount of money rather than trying to filthily rich? Does thinking this way means I am wrong?

Being not sad or frustrated is enough for me. Yes I do want all the fun in the world you're having, but looking at the risks, I don't think they are worth it.

Perhaps it all boils down to how much I hate being sad or frustrated, perhaps I treat the down hills too heavily, perhaps I care about losing too much. But I can not yet see a world where those are not the case.

So we all optimise for different things.

When the goal is having the most fun, it makes sense to jump through the hoops. So you see, that's your goal. Not mine. So here I'm not going to jump through the hoops. I would love to have the fun, yes, if someone would just hand it over to me, who wouldn't? But I don't want to jump through the hoops, so I'd rather not have them. 

For now I'm going back home, jump the hoops all you want, enjoy it, just don't count me in.
