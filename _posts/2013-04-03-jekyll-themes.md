**Update: 20 May 2013**

As Jekyll 1.0 released this post is getting a lot more traffic, therefore just so you know upfront, I made a stand-alone theme [Scribble](http://scribble.muan.co/2013/05/06/scribble-the-jekyll-theme/) which is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/muan/scribble). And, I am now working on **Wardrobe**, which would be a jekyll setup with 3-5 themes to start with, it is currently work in progress but you can have [a sneak preview here](http://themes.muan.co/), of one of the themes. 

Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/muanchiou) or [GitHub](https://github.com/muan/jekyll-wardrobe) to keep yourself in the loop. ♥

This is Mu-An. Over.

It’s a common habit for designers to redesign their sites once every when-I-feel-like-it. It could have been a month since the last redesign, but it might well have been only a day. I suffer from this horrible habit of mine aggressively.

Ever since I started using Jekyll (that’s about 50 days ago), there had been four themes. Yes, four. And during this period I have also made two themes for [Rob's blog](http://robertheaton.com) and another one for [I found this helped](http://ifoundthishelped.com). I spend way too much time on these things, but at the same time I do really love doing it, and Jekyll is extremely easy to work with!

Now, I am thinking instead of leaving the old themes buried in my commit logs, I should collect them all and make them available for all you current and future jekyll users with a gem/in a repository.

I think this could be pretty sweet. **I want to make more themes and let you use which one ever you feel like on the day easily.** Let me know whether and how much better this would make your life in the comments or just [tweet at me](https://twitter.com/share?text=How%20nice!%20@muanchiou,%20jekyll%20themes,%20yes%20definitely!), and when I get cracking I can then ask a little bird to tell you. 

At the moment I still have very little idea yet as how it should work, perhaps I will make a gem for it, or perhaps not, let me know if you have any thoughts on the practicalities.

It’s time for us all to [blog like a hacker](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html) with an endless wardrobe.
