Re: [The loss of a programmer’s identity](https://muan.co/notes/2026-02-14-aa)—It just reminded me the 2000 era when I used to write websites in notepad with `cgi-bin`, people tell me “what’s the big deal? I can build sites with FrontPage/Dreamweaver too.” 

“Gosh, the code is unreadable.” I thought. How wild this applies still 25 years later.
