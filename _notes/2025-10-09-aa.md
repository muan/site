I have a milk jug for coffee and it pisses me off everyday because the interior marking for volume starts at an arbitrary point and the markings are circles as opposed to lines, making something that’s already approximate even less accurate. I looked at the user manual and it does not say anything about the markings. I had to check Q&A on their website to find that each marking is approximately 75ml apart, but how much was the lowest marking? No idea. I know I can measure them with another measuring cup but like what the fuck. I am not gonna memorize this two years from now on if I wasn’t making coffee daily?!

I feel like I really missed my chance to go down the product design route after my degree. I think those challenges would have been less frustrating than the intersection between society and technology. But then again the me now think we don’t really need new things. Every time I found out how many completely trash items are being produced at a massive scale I am reminded that the earth is full of physical trash now, and now that we have also automated digital trash production soon we will have no escape in either the physical or digital space. A completely blank virtual reality might be desirable.

Going back to the milk jug, I think I really failed myself by purchasing this terrible product 3 years ago.
