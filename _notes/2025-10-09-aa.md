I have a milk jug for coffee and it pisses me off everyday because the interior marking for volume starts at an arbitrary point and the markings are circles as opposed to lines, making something that’s already approximate even less accurate. I looked at the user manual and it does not say anything about the markings. I had to check the Q&A on their website to find that each marking is approximately 75ml apart, but how much was the lowest marking? No idea. I know I can measure them with another measuring cup but like what the fuck. I am not gonna memorize this two years from now if I wasn’t making coffee daily.

I feel like I really missed my chance to go down the product design route after my degree. I think those challenges would have been less frustrating than the intersection between society and technology. But then again the me now think we don’t really need new things. Every time I find out yet another completely trash product is being produced at a massive scale I am reminded that the earth is full of physical trash. Now that we have also automated digital trash production, soon we will have no escape in either the physical or digital space. A completely blank virtual reality might have a selling point then.

Going back to the milk jug, I think I really failed myself by purchasing this terrible product last year for $40.
