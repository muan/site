Going on dates with really, really mediocre and boring men makes me feel so much better about myself. On the being a lot more achieved and independent part. They all weren't interested in me either though, so that is cool too.

The dates happened a long time ago and I am just saying thinking back on them still help, especially in deterring me from going on any more dates to waste my time.
