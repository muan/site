A decade ago I was in the kitchen of our startup apartment in my early 20s talking to my coworker who gave me his copy of Animal Liberation in the hope of converting me to veganism, only to have me say “I reject the entire premise Singer laid in the first chapter and I don’t think I can finish this.” I did finish the book but was apathetic, and I remember talking about views on lives back then that led to my coworker saying that he thinks my ideas constitute as depression. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
