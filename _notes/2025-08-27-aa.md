Iâ€™ve been cleaning and organizing my home and my friends are now tuned in to my Instagram stories in case they missed good deals and freebies. Sold a Fellow Ode for $30 (got Opus), two fancy cat litter boxes for $15 each (using Litter Robot + IKEA box), and gave away a HMM ceramic pourover (using Kalita Wave) and two cast iron pans (using De Buyer stainless steel) and many more. Gosh have I wasted so much money.
