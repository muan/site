Continuing from my [previous rant on Secular Buddhism](https://muan.co/notes/2025-10-10-aa), here’s more from the more researched and representative argument: [On radicalized secularization](https://youtu.be/VCLr9355aa0).

> Being able to define what is secular and what is not secular… that’s all about power. 

> …think about for whom is power being maintained, and who is being excluded, and for whom is this exclusion being naturalized.

> mindfulness is mechanized within neoliberalism to privatize some of the structural conditions effecting the society so they become our individual responsibility.

At the end, there’s an audience question about Secular Buddhism outside of the US, and Taiwan was mentioned as an example. In my opinion, culturally, MBSR is definitely an American Secular Buddhism export completely disconnected from its origin, which in turn amplifies internalized racism that is rampant here. Being aware of this and knowing religious Buddhists around me makes this phenomenon all the more uncomfortable.
