Continuing from my [previous rant on Secular Buddhism](https://muan.co/notes/2025-10-10-aa), here’s more from the more researched and representative argument: [On radicalized secularization](https://youtu.be/VCLr9355aa0).

> Being able to define what is secular and what is not secular… that’s all about power. 

> …think about for whom is power being maintained, and who is being excluded, and for whom is this exclusion being naturalized.

> mindfulness is mechanized within neoliberalism to privatize some of the structural conditions effecting the society so they become our individual responsibility.

At the end there’s an audience question about Secular Buddhism outside of the US and Taiwan is mentioned. I think culturally MBSR via Secular Buddhism is definitely an American export completely disconnected from its origin, which in term amplifies internalized racism. Being aware of this and knowing religious Buddhists around me, makes this American export all the more jarring.
