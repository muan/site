I have an [L-leg](https://www.artek.fi/en/collections/l-leg-collection) tattoo. 

Stool 60 is constructed from three legs made from solid Finnish birch, bent at the ends with slits and veneers inserted to fill the gaps.

IKEA Frosta is made from four bent plywood pieces with rounded ends, formed from the process.

I draw a parallel between this and the web—with one, you use the material while playing to its strength, utilizing its built-in grains and structure with minimal modifications, making it work for you; with the other, you break down the material completely and reassemble it with connectors, preserving very little of the material’s characteristics and living with the artifacts of such manipulation.

The former is durable but is more costly; the latter is suitable for mass production but is way less reliable.
