The vote was today and the result is bad. None of the Chinese Nationalist Party legislators were recalled. I am devastated. I am exhausted. I am disappointed. Though I am still very proud of us,… more than 1.3 million people signed petitions, volunteers canvassed the streets campaigning,… 3 books have been published so far documenting the movement (I am in two of them). I think this kind of civic mobilization is unmatched. Taiwanese people are pretty damn cool.
