The vote was today and the result is bad. None of the Chinese Nationalist Party legislators were recalled. I am devastated. I am exhausted. I am disappointed. Though I am still very proud of us,… more than 1.3 million people signed petitions, 1.6 million people voted in favor, volunteers canvassed the streets campaigning,… 3 books have been published so far documenting the movement (I am in two of them). I think this kind of civic mobilization is unmatched. Taiwanese people are pretty damn cool.

* note: only the existing pro-KMT districts voted becasue only their reps were getting recalled. it might seem like people are overwhelmingly for KMT but that is not statistically correct because the anti-KMT districts dont have a voice in the recall.
