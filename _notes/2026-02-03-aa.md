<details><summary>For those of you who worry about my mental health</summary>

I have been doing much better now, after completely getting off Venlafaxine which brought me a bunch of health complications and ER visits last March. I still have some left over issues that is compromising my physical abilities, like tachycardia, but in the grand scheme of things, that is fine.

I am sleeping a lot better, also continuing to be diligent about sleep hygiene. I haven’t had strong suicidal ideation for about 3 months, which is the longest stretch since 2022! What a feat!

Thanks to all of you who have stayed and sent me words of support. I think back on [You can try harder](https://muan.co/posts/try-harder) a lot, and I wish I could have been better at receiving words with good intentions, but I know the limits of the state of me then. To be kind to myself is to recognize and accept the state of my shortcomings and limitations. I apologized to whose who had been caught in the crosshairs.

Thanks for bearing with and continue to support me.
