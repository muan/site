20th Century Women (2016): Jamieâ€™s room has many nice furniture and good decor. Annette Baning is so good here; Unfortunately I don't care for the others.

I think this starts charming and then fell really flat. It's making me want to read [Sisterhood is Powerful](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/132084) though. Anyone in the US willing to keep an eye out for a copy for me?
