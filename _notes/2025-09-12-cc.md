A random memory from high school popped out of cold storage—this guy I met online and was talking daily suddenly stopped, and he replied, after I repeatedly asked what if anything happened, “didn’t I mention I saw a photo of you last time?” Oh. Got it. It’s not that he’s hurtful, it’s that I grew up with enough family members who think the same that had informed me exactly what “saw a photo of you” entails.
