Had a dream where a man I barely know saw that I bought a valentines gift box from a very nice brand and said “What?! You should waited so I can get it for you,” as he excitedly check out what’s in the box. And in the dream I replied, “What? I bought myself apartments and diamond rings. Wait? For?”

The man was obviously not serious and was just saying things. But my response ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯.
