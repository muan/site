Got a new tattoo today. In memory of [White Terror (started officially on May 20, 1949)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Terror_(Taiwan)) with a [Formosa Lily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilium_formosanum). 

Befriended the tattoo artist, who is on the same political spectrum. We chatted for hours; she thinks I am very cool and was glad she gets to ink me. ðŸ¥¹

She is from a classical arts background, did a freehand tattoo on me, and said said that I am a model client with the most ideal skin type that is extremely easy to tattoo ðŸ˜Œ. It made me happy that she enjoyed the process and was proud of the work ðŸ¥°.
