I heard someone posted my site on the orange site again because of GitHub. Hi. Glad the CSS issue is fixed by WebKit but gotta say, it has been slow for a long time. I think it is obvious that GitHub leadership (Microsoft) does not care about us/you. Those of us who worked there before the acquisition loved the community and the product to death, and now you have people who don’t know what GitHub is making decisions. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

Did you get the memo that AI is king? A current hubber wants you to know this:

> This (Grok in Copilot) was pushed out with a rushed security review, a coerced and unwilling engineering team, and in full opposition to our supposed company values. 
> 
> If you don’t want it, tell them. Social media and support forums. Leadership won't listen to employees. https://github.blog/changelog/2025-08-26-grok-code-fast-1-is-rolling-out-in-public-preview-for-github-copilot/
