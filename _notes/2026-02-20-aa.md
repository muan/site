As someone who has *lived* in two countries paying tax and going through medical systems in a foreign language with *no support systems* in place, I can not emphasize more on how difficult and stressful it is on one’s daily life. That is partly why I had it in the US amidst COVID and visa issues with my employer and HR being useless in terms of support.

My rule of thumb now is, unless you have family, partner, or close friends in the different country you aim to uproot your life to (close enough that you can let them decide legal matters—so legal professionals you can afford would count too), expect a very hard transition and ongoing stress. 

I see so many Americans acting like surprised Pikachu when they realize being an immigrant is hard when they finally *trial* it. And their attempt isn’t even on hard (level); Treating these moves as an extended stay and easily reversible. I am talking about navigating language and cultural difference, tax implications, different government bureaucracies.

Respect immigrants!
