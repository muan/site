Depressing topic on Taiwanese Threads caused me to finally delete the app: Visually impaired user voiced concern with LINE removing their web version when the native apps are completely inaccessible; since LINE is used a lot in professional capacities this kills people’s livelihood, and so they’re asking for support. However, the majority of Taiwanese users responded with hostility, arguing that there is no money in accessibility and that people asking accessibility features are asking for special treatment.

I don’t know what to say. I think I am just all out of spoons.
