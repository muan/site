I’m kinda sad about how people are now moving to linktree-like services. In Taiwan there’s portaly which also has shop and newsletter services it seems. The web experience is getting worse and worse *however* I do see how the utility that they provide. This I guess is not new to other industries like the mass production of everything, the craft becomes a luxury. I guess this feels particularly bad because surfing and creating on the web should not be a luxury.
