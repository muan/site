A introduced me to B when she was briefly back to Taiwan. I didn’t talk much at the party because I don’t enjoy crowds nor alcohol. I made an excuse to leave and met B by the restrooms, we talked for a long time, and really vibed. B confessed later, “My girlfriend (C) taught me all that. I am just reciting words. You two would really get along.”

I met C and we are definitely on the same wavelength. I ended up hanging with B & C a bunch.

A finally met C the other day, and she told me C couldn’t stop talking about how great I am and how much they likes me. B was almost jealous sayong C and I make a better couple. I said “wow I really thought they were only hanging by because I am the depressed friend you assigned to them. They really didn't have to include me in their couple outings but they did and were so nice.”

Anyways. Remember my review on Baby Reindeer? I empathize with Martha so much.

I wonder if/how I can grow? into the character that is loved and appreciated by my friends.
