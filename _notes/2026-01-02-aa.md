Honestly still don’t quite know the point of “Happy New Year.” I used to really struggle with this, but now I have accepted my part in the society that I will respond with the words reflexively. But still, I’d prefer if this isn’t said to me. Especially from those who have no idea how my year went. It just feels very phony. I don’t need phony people in my life.
