From repeatedly failing to find good D&D experiences, I realized at the end of the day it’s not about the games it’s about the friends. So now I’m back playing Baldur’s Gate 3 (for the nth time) and Overwatch with friends that I used to play with. It’s been really nice, and the social interaction really fuels oneself.
