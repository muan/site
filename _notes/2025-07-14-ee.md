I have some thoughts about pottering. Here’s some quick notes:

- wheel is therapeutic
- wheel helps me face imperfections
- can’t possibly have a studio of my own
- I don’t want a studio of my own
- I want to get better at it badly
- I only want to be more skillful and enjoy the process
- it’s not about the product- I don’t want the product honestly- the idea of living with an item in a state of inadequacy sounds painful
- I feel icky with most of the hobby ceramists turned professionals- the capitalization of all hobbies is gross
- I just want to enjoy making and not living with trash
- it’s too permanent

All that said I still think wheel throwing is magical and healing. Is there something like it?
