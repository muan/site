Belfast (2021): As films from a child’s perspective goes, the empire of the sun remains my absolute favorite. This one fell flat and I neeeeeeded more historical context. Here I go digging for more Irish history films/documentaries. 

Please send recommendations my way. The Wind that Shakes the Barley is my all time favorite which had me bawling multiple times, but I don’t recall any others on the subject, especially post WWII.
