German tutor: I think we can start lesson 3 today. Unless you’d like to read through these last pieces of exercises for Formular Information?

Me: That should be quick I think? I just want to make sure my pronunciation is decent.
Tutor: Sure! 

(One hour later)

Tutor: OK so lesson 3 next week. 😅

Me: (still can’t pronounce “verheiratet” consistently)
