Last Night (1998): A film about how people spend their last few hours on earth with an imminent extinction event. I wouldn’t have checked this out if not for Sandra Oh. I like mumblecore films so it’s not the lack of twists and turns that annoyed me, it’s the really really bland script. Straight male friends discussing whether they should try anal sex is not it. 2 ⚹
