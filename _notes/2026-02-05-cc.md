A friend told me to use LLM for something… and said it’s often correct in a particular area. Idk. I just asked one to rank some classic designs of flip clocks and it got things wrong and misattributed designers multiple times, then double down when I pointed it out.

I think LLMs are most correct in the things we don’t know the answer to. Sure, whatever you outputted must be true.

I also met up with a friend who works at one of the big LLM companies and he told me their product got so much better at coding in an unbelievable speed. So I asked him, is it better at x, y, and z? The things that made it basically unusable to me? The answer is no, and they are known issues people are still working on them. This really makes me wonder what the amazing developments were… if it continues to be incapable of doing the most basic things I can use help with?
