This week I…

- finished a book
- started another one, half way through
- changed bass strings
- talked to friends about contracting potentially
- practice songs and peeled off the skins on my fingers
- went to band practice
- sunk tens of hours into stardew valley (give me tips)
- baked pretzels, gave away shoes to friends who visited me
- watched 5 movies

It was a horrible week but I pulled through. I almost canceled on my friend but she is always a delight.

Band practice went ok. We did covers of 十二月的你 by 滅火器, minimum by Muse, and Sweet Child o’ Mine. I am so much worse than my teenager years but glad I was still somehow able to transcribe the bass lines. 

This week I didn’t…

- cook really; cheated on fibers by drinking frozen spinach
- wash dishes
- get groceries
- workout
- expose myself to the sun
- sleep at proper times
