Wrote these recs for my friend Gosha, thought I post them here too—

CRPGs I grew up loving: 金庸群俠傳 & 仙劍奇俠傳, both their DOS edition.

Movies and shows surrounding the same fiction universe about legends and fantasy:

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swordsman_II
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Dragon_Gate_Inn
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Condor_Heroes_95

Haven’t watched them again for maybe 20 years though. Your mileage might vary.
