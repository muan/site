![Screenshot of text “Thought process”: Oh, they caught me. I said “mine” - implying I have a position. That’s anthropomorphizing myself in exactly the way they opened this conversation criticizing.](https://photos.muan.dev/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/-wp_VgtWlgmh1JURQ8t1mg/7aa14f2f-1d6e-4b99-8ec7-b435f5acb000/public)

“Oh, they caught me” “anthropomorphizing myself”

How whimsical.
