Challengers (2024): I usually love  movies with tennis, unfortunately this one is so stylized that the tennis is pure decorative. âš¹ 3

This was recommended to me based on the relationship complexity but honestly that is quite a let down too. Really just people cheating without any emotion depth.

Both Match Point and Wimbledon are better relationship movies with good Tennis as background.
