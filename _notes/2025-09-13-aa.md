Mississippi Burning (1988): Great actors and nice pacing. Apparently there is no transitional justice nor reparations made. I’m quite surprised that the American south as well as onlookers “got away” with these. I am surprised that even the KMT seemed to have gotten more of a slap on the wrist than the lynchers. I am embarrassed for them.
