Brennen Lee Mulligan as Evan Kelmp in Misfits and Magic season 2 is so freaking relatable. Especially down to how Evan got killed and saw his friends trying to save him as a ghost and said “I understand the sentiment, but Evan does not want to be brought back.” I sobbed hard during this episode. Also Lou Wilson as Jammer was sooooo on point.</details>
