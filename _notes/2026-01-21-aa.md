Soooo, hello. I haven’t updated things for a while; because upon upgrading my phone, all my photo uploading shortcuts disappeared.

I haven’t had much to write about—not that I ever had. I am still deeply into making dice, and I continue to further my investment in the process. The equipments are beginning to take up precious real estate that will eat into the price per 坪.

I have taken and developed photos but don’t have the brain power to rewrite those shortcuts. Perhaps I should take this chance to offload more responsibility into the GitHub actions… hmm. 

okbyethx.
