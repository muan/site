It really irks me that in reading more about the intersections of philosophy and AI that I continuously run into white men’s take on this so-called “secular Buddhism.” What the fuck? A religion that gets hollowed out to be so devoid of its original belief system yet still cocooned in the seemingly mysterious oriental shell.

Having grown up around traditional religions and actual devoted practitioners in Asia, this version of white buddhism that is highly individualized feels so distorted. It is such a shallow perspective akin to people fetishizing Asian women without reflecting on the societal/cultural construct that oppresses and exploits.
