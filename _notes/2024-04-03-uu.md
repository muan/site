You might have heard about a huge earthquake in Taiwan today. The biggest since 1999 (I slept through that one). I am safe. My apartment is fine, and it seems like all my neighbors and their apartments/buildings are good too. 

There's likely going to be potentially bigger aftershocks and it will be raining for a few days. Hope all get rescued in time.

For me I am personally not too concerned cause 橫豎都是命 🙃 so don't worry too much. Stay safe out there my friends in Taiwan.
