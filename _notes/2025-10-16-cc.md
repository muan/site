> If something is inaccessible then it doesn’t work well. It might work, but not well! -[Toby Osbourn](https://masto.ai/@tosbourn/115377103277437578)

So many directions I can side eye towards with this statement. 

I am extremely judgmental towards “design leaders” who praise design that is not accessible. To exclude accessibility as a qualifier for good design is a sure sign of incompetency.

I know, what have I ever done to claim such a thing? Don’t listen to me then. Move along.
