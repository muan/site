Therapy notes:

I got better at getting along with myself. I always thought I’ was very good at being alone, and she was like, huh tell me more (what a weird belief)? Yea I am very independent… but I guess I was mostly very critical against myself. So my loneliness “works” but it’s never really a worthwhile experience.

Last week during the bad, bad times, I surprised myself with a carefully curated film and book list that allow me to marinate in my thoughts. I forced myself to turn in instead of spiral. I told myself tomorrow is a new day. She said, “you were so incredibly kind to yourself.” 

I never thought of it this way. She asked me to put it into words. I said… I guess I was working with the state of me, and allowing it to be what it was. Old me was more likely to be annoyed at the state of me and spiral into judging myself as incompetent of regulating emotions.

Interesting.
