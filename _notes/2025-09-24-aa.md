Therapy notes:

I got better at getting along with myself. I always thought I was good at being alone, and my therapist looked confused and asked me to elaborate.

Right. I am very independent… but I guess I was introspective insofar as mostly just being non-constructively critical against myself. So my loneliness “works” or even "progresses" but it is never really a worthwhile experience.

Last week during the bad times, I carefully curated films and books that allow me to sit with my thoughts. I researched in order to make sure whatever I plan for myself weren't going to lead me to spiral. I told myself tomorrow is a new day. 

I told my therapist that… I guess I got better at depressive eisodes. I worked with the state of me, and allowed it to be what it was. Old me was more likely to be annoyed at the state of me and spiral into judging myself as incompetent of regulating emotions.

Yay.
